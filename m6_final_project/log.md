So far I've just been printing parts from https://www.littlefrenchkev.com/bluetooth-nerf-turret

After 3 failed attempts I switched to tree supports. These look way better than before and I just need to print the legs now

Just got the motor to work with the MOSFET, so now I have an electronic switch to control the motors

Moving some code and reference code into the template so I can keep track.

next up is just verifying and assembling the 3D print
